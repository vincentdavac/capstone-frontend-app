            COASTELLA strategically deploys its solar-powered, IoT-based buoys
            in coastal areas that are most vulnerable to environmental hazards.
            These buoys gather accurate, real-time data on water levels, wind
            speed, wave activity, and water quality to help communities,
            authorities, and stakeholders make informed decisions. By combining
            sustainable technology with early warning systems, we strengthen
            disaster preparedness, protect lives, and contribute to the
            preservation of our marine environment.

                The COASTELLA Deployment Map shows the current locations of our
                active buoys along vulnerable coastal areas. Each site is chosen
                through hazard mapping and community consultations to ensure
                that monitoring is focused on high-risk and high-priority
                locations. By targeting these areas, we can deliver real-time
                alerts and accurate data to support disaster preparedness and
                coastal safety.

                From site selection to full deployment, our team works to
                position each buoy where it can make the most impact. This
                network of buoys forms a reliable early warning system, helping
                communities stay informed, respond quickly, and protect both
                lives and marine environments.
